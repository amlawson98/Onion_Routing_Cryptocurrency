# Onion_Routing_Cryptocurrency
AlexTorPathCoin - A Cryptocurrency with New Money Generation from Multi-Party Onion Routing

Abstract:
We provide a ‘Proof-of-Bandwidth’ alt-coin protocol that incentivizes participants to participate in Onion-Routing, like that of the Tor Browser.
New currency is generated to a reward users for verified message routings.
A path determination protocol is included that protects the anonymity of clients, while restricting adversarial clients from generating currency without routing, and requiring no central or trusted authority. 
Additionally, it allows for substantial decreases in total path latency when compared with randomized router assignment protocols like TorPath/TorCoin.
